<h1> means top-level heading
<p> means paragraph. <ul> <li> for unordered (bulleted) list
Formatting information (<i> for italic)
Additional information to display (e.g.<img>)

You can use an HTML entity name to add such symbols to an HTML page. If an entity name does not exist, you can use a decimal, hexadecimal reference, or entity number.
Some characters are reserved in HTML. If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags. Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

9) How is Cell padding different from cell spacing? With Example.
 Ans :  Cell padding:

Cell padding specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell.
t specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents. It is created by using HTML <table> tag but type attribute is set to cell padding. It is mainly meant for a single cell.
The default cell padding value is 1. Cell padding is widely used and considered to be an effective mean. Cell padding is an attribute. 

Syntax:
<table cell padding="value" >.....</table>

Cell spacing:
Cell spacing specifies the space between cells (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the edges of the adjacent cells.It specifies the space between adjacent cells.
It is also created by using HTML <table> tag but type attribute is set to cells pacing.  Cell spacing can get subjected to more than one cell. Whereas, the default cell spacing value is 2.  Cell Spacing is less effective than Cell padding. Cells pacing is also an attribute.

10) How club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? with Example.
 Ans : club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table, you use the 'rowpan' and 'colpan' attributes within the '<td>' or '<th>' elements.

11) What is the different between block-level element and an inline element?
 Ans : A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

Syntax:
<span>.....</span>
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
   <title>HTML span tag</title>
</head>

<body>
   <h3>Tutorialspoint</h3>
   <!-- Creating span Element -->

16) What are active link different from normal link?
Ans : Normal link :
which are also known as links, are crucial components in websites nowadays. These are clickable and can be used to navigate between source webpage to different pages or the sections in the same webpage.
In most of the websites, the links will appear as underlined and differently colored.

Active Links :
An Active link is a hyperlink that is currently being interacted with the user. Whenever the user holds the mouse button on the link and not released yet or if right clicked on it, it will change its color into red, this is when the link will be in active state.

The main advantage of the section tag is, it is a semantic element, that describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Syntax: 
<section> Section Contents </section>

Nested Section tag:
The section tag can be nested. The font size of subsection is smaller than section tag if the text contains the same font property. The subsection tag is used for organizing complex documents. A rule of thumb is that section should logically appear in outline of the document.

18)What is SVG?
Ans : SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web SVG defines graphics in XML format. Each element and attribute in SVG files can be animated SVG is a W3C recommendation SVG integrates with other standards, such as CSS, DOM, XSL and JavaScript.

Example:
 
<svg height="500" width="100%">
<rect x="10" height="100px" wight="100px" rx="10px" ry="10px" 
style="fill: white; stroke: blue; stroke-width:3px"></rect>

<circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50">
style="100" fill: transparent; stroke: blue stroke-width: 3px;"></circle>

<line x1="'200"y1="100" x2="300" y2="200" style="stroke: black-width:5px"></line>
<line x1="'300"y1="100" x2="200" y2="200" style="stroke: black-width:5px"></line>


19)what is deferent between HTML and XHTML?
 Ans : HTML and XHTML are both languages in which web pages are written. HTML is SGML-based while XHTML is XML-based. They are like two sides of the same coin. XHTML was derived from HTML to conform to XML standards. Hence XHTML is strict when compared to HTML and does not allow user to get away with lapses in coding and structure.The reason for XHTML to be developed was convoluted browser specific tags. Pages coded in HTML appeared different in different browsers.HTML is the predominant mark up language for web pages. HTML creates structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text like headings, lists, links, quotes etc. It allows images and objects to be embedded to create interactive forms. It is written as tags surrounded by angle brackets - for example, <html>. Scripts in languages like JavaScript can also be loaded.

HTML	
HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.

XHTML
XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which web pages are written.

20)What are logical and physical tag in HTML?
Ans : Logical Tags
Logical tags, also known as semantic tags, are used to provide additional meaning to the content of an HTML document. They help search engines and other assistive technologies to better understand the structure and content of the document.Logical tags in HTML are elements that are used to structure the content semantically, without directly affecting the appearance. These tags provide meaning to the content and help search engines and screen readers understand the structure of the webpage. 

Physical tags 
Physical tags in HTML are elements that are used to structure the content on a webpage. These tags directly affect the appearance of the content and are visible to the user. Some examples of physical tags include heading tags, paragraph tags, and image tags. tag is a heading tag that creates a large, bold heading on the webpage. The
tag is a paragraph tag that creates a block of text. The  tag is an image tag that displays an image on the webpage.
