//Q.61 Array vs object defences in JS?

1. Arrays in JavaScript

    An Array is a special type of object in JavaScript that is used to store multiple values in a single variable.Arrays are ordered collections, and the values(known as elements) are stored at numeric indexes, starting from 0.

2. Objects in JavaScript

    An Object in JavaScript is a collection of key - value pairs, where each key(or property) is associated with a value.Unlike arrays, objects do not store data in an ordered manner and allow you to access values using keys (which can be strings or symbols), rather than numeric indexes.
