Q2. Explain your communication style?
Ans:
I would describe my communication style as direct and honest. Since I do not like when people play games with me, saying things they do not really mean, I do not do the same to them
I know that sometimes people may find my words hard to swallow, especially if I share a difficult feedback with them, but in a long run I believe it is the best communication style for the company, since my message is always clear, and everybody cooperating with me knows what they are supposed to do. while I had mixed success in relationships at school and in my private life, and definitely can learn something from those relationships that failedâ€“communication is always to blame here, at least partially.
